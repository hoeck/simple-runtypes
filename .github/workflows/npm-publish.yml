# Instructions:
#
# Setup:
#
#   1. ensure in npm account settings you have 2FA setup for authorization only or disabled
#   2. in npm "Access Tokens" create a new token for read and publish
#   3. in github repository "Settings" -> "Secrets" add that npm token with name "NPM_TOKEN" (as used in the action file)
#
# Create a New Release:
#
#   1. commit (and maybe push) all your changes and ensure action "unit-tests" succeeds
#   2. create a new git version tag: `yarn version --patch` (see yarn help version for more options)
#   3. push new tag to github: `git push --follow-tags`
#
# Re-run the release action (after an error)
#
# Because the action is only triggered when a new tag is pushed, you'll need to:
#
#   1. delete the failed version on the remote and locally:
#        `git push --delete origin v1.2.3`
#        `git tag --delete v1.2.3`
#   2. recreate the annotated tag:
#        `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m v1.2.3
#   3. push
#        `git push --follow-tags`
